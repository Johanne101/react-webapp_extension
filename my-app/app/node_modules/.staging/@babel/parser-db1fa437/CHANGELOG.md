### :bug: Regression

- Revert "Fix export default async function to be FunctionDeclaration" ([#375](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/375))

Need to modify Babel for this AST node change, so moving to 7.0.

- Revert "Don't parse class properties without initializers when classProperties plugin is disabled, and Flow is enabled" ([#376](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/376))

[react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12542) broke with this so we reverted.

## 6.16.0 (2017-02-23)

### :rocket: New Feature

***ESTree*** compatibility as plugin ([#277](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/277)) (Daniel Tschinder)

We finally introduce a new compatibility layer for ESTree. To put babylon into ESTree-compatible mode the new plugin `estree` can be enabled. In this mode the parser will output an AST that is compliant to the specs of [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree/)

We highly recommend everyone who uses babylon outside of babel to use this plugin. This will make it much easier for users to switch between different ESTree-compatible parsers. We so far tested several projects with different parsers and exchanged their parser to babylon and in nearly all cases it worked out of the box. Some other estree-compatible parsers include `acorn`, `esprima`, `espree`, `flow-parser`, etc.

To enable `estree` mode simply add the plugin in the config:
```json
{
  "plugins": [ "estree" ]
}
```

If you want to migrate your project from non-ESTree mode to ESTree, have a look at our [Readme](https://github.com/babel/babylon/#output), where all deviations are mentioned.

Add a parseExpression public method ([#213](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/213)) (jeromew)

Babylon exports a new function to parse a single expression

```js
import { parseExpression } from 'babylon';

const ast = parseExpression('x || y && z', options);
```

The returned AST will only consist of the expression. The options are the same as for `parse()`

Add startLine option ([#346](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/346)) (Raphael Mu)

A new option was added to babylon allowing to change the initial linenumber for the first line which is usually `1`.
Changing this for example to `100` will make line `1` of the input source to be marked as line `100`, line `2` as `101`, line `3` as `102`, ...

Function predicate declaration ([#103](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/103)) (Panagiotis Vekris)

Added support for function predicates which flow introduced in version 0.33.0

```js
declare function is_number(x: mixed): boolean %checks(typeof x === "number");
```

Allow imports in declare module ([#315](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/315)) (Daniel Tschinder)

Added support for imports within module declarations which flow introduced in version 0.37.0

```js
declare module "C" {
  import type { DT } from "D";
  declare export type CT = { D: DT };
}
```

### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance

Forbid semicolons after decorators in classes ([#352](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/352)) (Kevin Gibbons)

This example now correctly throws an error when there is a semicolon after the decorator:

```js
class A {
@a;
foo(){}
}
```

Keywords are not allowed as local specifier ([#307](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/307)) (Daniel Tschinder)

Using keywords in imports is not allowed anymore:

```js
import { default } from "foo";
import { a as debugger } from "foo";
```

Do not allow overwritting of primitive types ([#314](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/314)) (Daniel Tschinder)

In flow it is now forbidden to overwrite the primitive types `"any"`, `"mixed"`, `"empty"`, `"bool"`, `"boolean"`, `"number"`, `"string"`, `"void"` and `"null"` with your own type declaration.

Disallow import type { type a } from â€¦ ([#305](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/305)) (Daniel Tschinder)

The following code now correctly throws an error

```js
import type { type a } from "foo";
```

Don't parse class properties without initializers when classProperties is disabled and Flow is enabled ([#300](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/300)) (Andrew Levine)

Ensure that you enable the `classProperties` plugin in order to enable correct parsing of class properties. Prior to this version it was possible to parse them by enabling the `flow` plugin but this was not intended the behaviour.

If you enable the flow plugin you can only define the type of the class properties, but not initialize them.

Fix export default async function to be FunctionDeclaration ([#324](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/324)) (Daniel Tschinder)

Parsing the following code now returns a `FunctionDeclaration` AST node instead of `FunctionExpression`.

```js
export default async function bar() {};
```

### :nail_care: Polish

AST spec: fix casing of `RegExpLiteral` ([#318](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/318)) (Mathias Bynens)

## 6.15.0 (2017-01-10)

### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance

Add support for Flow shorthand import type ([#267](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/267)) (Jeff Morrison)

This change implements flows new shorthand import syntax
and where previously you had to write this code:

```js
import {someValue} from "blah";
import type {someType} from "blah";
import typeof {someOtherValue} from "blah";
```

you can now write it like this:

```js
import {
  someValue,
  type someType,
  typeof someOtherValue,
} from "blah";
```

For more information look at [this](https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/2890) pull request.

flow: allow leading pipes in all positions ([#256](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/256)) (Vladimir Kurchatkin)

This change now allows a leading pipe everywhere types can be used:
```js
var f = (x): | 1 | 2 => 1;
```

Throw error when exporting non-declaration ([#241](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/241)) (Kai Cataldo)

Previously babylon parsed the following exports, although they are not valid:
```js
export typeof foo;
export new Foo();
export function() {};
export for (;;);
export while(foo);
```

### :bug: Bug Fix

Don't set inType flag when parsing property names ([#266](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/266)) (Vladimir Kurchatkin)

This fixes parsing of this case:

```js
const map = {
  [age <= 17] : 'Too young'
};
```

Fix source location for JSXEmptyExpression nodes (fixes #248) ([#249](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/249)) (James Long)

The following case produced an invalid AST
```js
<div>{/* foo */}</div>
```

Use fromCodePoint to convert high value unicode entities ([#243](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/243)) (Ryan Duffy)

When high value unicode entities (e.g. ðŸ’©) were used in the input source code they are now correctly encoded in the resulting AST.

Rename folder to avoid Windows-illegal characters ([#281](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/281)) (Ryan Plant)

Allow this.state.clone() when parsing decorators ([#262](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/262)) (Alex Rattray)

### :house: Internal

User external-helpers ([#254](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/254)) (Daniel Tschinder)

Add watch script for dev ([#234](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/234)) (Kai Cataldo)

Freeze current plugins list for "*" option, and remove from README.md ([#245](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/245)) (Andrew Levine)

Prepare tests for multiple fixture runners.
