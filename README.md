### React:

***Web Framework***
<p>
React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for
building user interfaces or UI components.
It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM,
so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing.
React Router is an example of such a library.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))
